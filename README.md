# Multi-Layer Perceptron
## Built From Scratch in Python

#### Overview
In this assignment, we were tasked with the creation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with a
variety of tests to validate it can “learn” data successfully. The MLP is coded in Python and
contains an input layer of NI input units, a hidden layer of NH hidden units, and an output
layer of NO output units. Design methodology, coding decisions, results and discussion are provided in the included report.

#### Running the MLP
Execute the python file _mlp.py_ and each of the tests will be run, with error printed for each.
